`Output Terminal`
```
=== [INPUT] ===
Enter the values you want to perform the operations on : 
Enter the value of A : 5
Enter the value of B : 8

=== [Arithmetic Operations] ===
=== [Binary Arithmetic Operation (Operating on 2 operands)] ===
A (5) + B (8) = 13
A (5) - B (8) = -3
A (5) * B (8) = 40
A (5) / B (8) = 0.6250
A (5) % B (8) = 5

=== [Unary Arithmetic Operation (Operating on 1 operand)] ===
A++ : 5
Value changed to => A : 6
++A : 7
Value changed to => A : 7
--B : 7
Value changed to => B : 7
B-- : 7
Value changed to => B : 6

=== [Relational Operations] ===
A (7) == B (6) (Is A equal to B?) :                         0
A (7) != B (6) (Is A not equal to B?) :                     1
A (7) >  B (6) (Is A greater than B?) :                     1
A (7) >= B (6) (Is A greater than or equal to B?) :         1
A (7) <  B (6) (Is A less than B?) :                        0
A (7) <= B (6) (Is A less than or equal to B?) :            0

=== [Logical Operations] ===
A (0) % 2 == 0 || B (-4) % 2 == 1 (A is even or B is odd) :         0
A (1) % 2 == 0 && B (-4) % 2 == 0 (A is even and B is even) :       0
!(A (7) == B (6)) !(A is equal to B) => (A is not equal to B) :     1

=== [Assignment Operations] ===
Result = a * 10; Result :
B -= 2 => B = 4
A += 10 => A = 17
A *= 2 => A = 34
A /= 10 => A = 3
A = 10 => A = 3

=== [Ternary Operations] ===

 B (4) << 1      : 8
 B (4) >> 1      : 2
```

## Notes

### 🧮 Compound (Shorthand) Assignment Operators

Compound assignment operators like `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `%=` are used to simplify expressions where a variable is operated on and then reassigned to itself.

Instead of writing :
```c
a = a * 2;
```

You can use : 
```c
a *= 2;
```

> [!NOTE]
These aren't just syntax sugar—compilers handle them as dedicated operations and may generate slightly different (sometimes more efficient) code than the expanded form.


⚠️ Be careful with operand order:
```c
a -= b; 
b -= a;
```
The first means `a = a - b`;
The second means `b = b - a`;

### ❓ Ternary (Conditional) Operator
The ternary operator is a compact way to conditionally assign values. It behaves like an if-else expression and is often used in single-line assignments.

Traditional if-else:

```c
int isOver18;

if (age >= 18)
{
    isOver18 = 1;
}
else
{
    isOver18 = 0;
}
```
Same logic using a ternary operator:


```c
int isOver18 = (age >= 18) ? 1 : 0;
```
```c
<variable> = <condition> ? <value_if_true> : <value_if_false>;
```
If the condition is true, value_if_true is assigned. Otherwise, `value_if_false` is assigned.

> [!NOTE]
While it behaves like an if-else, the ternary operator is not rewritten by the compiler into if-else code. The compiler handles it as an expression and may even optimize it more efficiently in some cases. Use it to write "cleaner" and shorter logic when appropriate.

### 33. Time Adder 
Write a program in C to add two times taken in hours, minutes, and second format `T1 = {hour1, minute1, second1}`, `T2 = {hour2, minute2, second2}` and add them up and display the output in this format : `T3 = {hour3, minute3, second3}`. 

The Maths behind the solution is quite simple, we simply need to add the corresponding values from `T1` and `T2` and if they are more than what they could be then they are to be converted (`Seconds if more than 60 get converted into Minutes and similarly minutes when larger than 60 get converted into hours`)
```
Seconds = (T1_Seconds + T2_Seconds) % 60
Minutes = (T1_Minutes + T2_Minutes) % 60 + (T1_Seconds + T2_Seconds) / 60
Hours = (T1_Hours + T2_Hours) + (T1_Minutes + T2_Minutes) / 60 + (T1_Seconds + T2_Seconds) / 60
```


`Answer` [timeAdder.c](src/timeAdder.c)

```
=== [INPUT] ===
Enter T1 : 
Hour : 5

### 34. Distance Adder 
Write a program in C to add two distances taken in feet and inches, format `D1 = {feet1, inch1}`, `D2 = {feet2, inch2}` and add them up and display the output in this format : `D3 = {feet3, inch3}`. 

The Maths behind the solution is once again quite simple, (It is similar to the previous) we simply need to add the corresponding values from `D1` and `D2` and if they are more than what they could be then they are to be converted (`Inches if more than 12 get converted into feet`)

```
Inches = (D1_Inches + D2_Inches) % 12
Feet = (D1_Feet + D2_Feet) + ((D1_Inches + D2_Inches) / 12)
```

`Answer` [distanceAdder.c](src/distanceAdder.c)

### 58. Greatest Common Divisor

To calculate the G.C.D. one can use [Euclidean Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm) which is an efficient method developed by ancient Greek mathematician Euclid. The algorithm works by repeatedly applying the division algorithm, where the larger number is replaced by the remainder of the division until the remainder becomes zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD of the original two numbers.

WAP in C to input a number `length` and create an array of length `length`, enter elements into that array and then find the largest element in that array. Assume that the elements are all positive (So the smallest can be 0 and the largest can be infinity).

> [!NOTE]
So we can assume the maximum to be 0 and then compare this maximum with every element of the array. If the element is larger than the previous maximum then we set maximum equal to this element and continue till the end.

> [!NOTE]
If all sorts of values are allowed, then the default value of max must be INT_MIN and not 0. For which one must use the `limit.h` file. We use this header in the next question.

### 68. 2D Array Initialization

`Answer` [2D-arrayInit.c](src/2D-arrayInit.c)

`Output Terminal`
```
=== [INPUT] ===
---Enter order of the array---
Enter the number of rows : 3
Enter the number of columns : 3

---Enter elements of the array---

Element at 1, 2 : 6
Element at 2, 0 : 7

### 69. Prime Checker
WAP in C to input a number `n` from the user and check whether it is prime or composite.
A number is a prime number if it is a `+ve` number more than 1 `(n > 1)` and has only 2 factors, them being `1` and the number itself `(n)`.<br />

1 itself is considered to be neither prime nor composite as it only has one factor that being itself. And `-ve` numbers are considered to be neither prime nor composite as they are not `+ve` which goes against the definition of a prime number.

> [!NOTE]
We can solve this in various ways, but most of them work on the principle of simply counting the number of factors the number has. So we can start a loop from 1 till `n` and count the numbers which are `n`'s factors. To optimize it we can optimize it further by running the loop from `2` to `n/2` or even better to `sqrt(n)` as if any other number in that range is a factor of `n` that directly means `n` is composite.

`Output Terminal`
```
=== [INPUT] ===
Enter the number : 3

=== [OUTPUT] ===
3 is prime
```

### 70. Matrix Addition
WAP in C to input 2 matrices of the same order `n` * `m` and then add them up then print the output matrix in the console.

> The requirement for matrix multiplication is that the number of columns of the first matrix should be equal to the number of rows of the second matrix. 
> The output matrix has the order equal to the row count of the 1st matrix and the column count of the 2nd matrix.

## Setup
All C programs in this repository were written and tested on Windows using:

- [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) as the GCC compiler
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the editor
- [Code Runner extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner) to easily compile and run .c files with a single shortcut key

### Installing MinGW using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
To install the MinGW compiler, I used [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), a Windows package manager. If you want to install [choco](https://chocolatey.org/), you can follow this [guide](https://chocolatey.org/install).

And then you can install the compiler by pasting this command in your command prompt  
```
choco install mingw
```
> You will be recommended to do this while running the shell as an Administrator.

### Running  the code
Press `Ctrl + Alt + N` to compile and run the code (using the [Code Runner extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner)).
The output will appear in the `OUTPUT` tab of the integrated terminal. You can also change the keyboard shortcut in `Settings` or create a custom macro for it.
